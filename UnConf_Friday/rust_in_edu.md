Moving forward with education and Rust Education.

A few years ago Future way gave Bart money to get Rust into University Collorculum. And the basic idea was to write some corriculum and then he also ran with that and created RustEdu wit hteh goal to getting this into Universities but also how to teach this in general also in industry and such.

They have had some successess and they have held a workshop for Rust educators for people to present papers and this was virtual and probably will be again next time. And they have put some people in contact and got some things going.

The pace had a strong start and then it slowed down in the last 6 months or so.

Go do https://rust-edu.org and sign up for the Zullip chat there and it has sort of slowed down. Wants to talk about successes and our future and what kind of things they can do to get more people with an interest in helping with this problem of educating in Rust.

Teaching 

Jerimiah works for Go Daddy and is the Rust language speciliast for the company. 

Works at Rust tools at Meta and looking into how to help people onboard.

Bart has taught Rust since around 2016/2017. Barton Massey

Need to figure out how to get the people to talk to each other like the people in this room. Hoping to find a bunch of people and thinks that there is an ability to get more funding if they can do a credible job. And maybe teach Rust in OS and Embedded if not just teach a Rust class like Bart has been doing for a while.

What would you want in a Rust Edu? What kind of mistakes have been made?

At someone's university they taught Python in the first year and then a general multithreading course in the 2nd year and as a student felt like this was motivational but turned off of C because of so many segfaults. But you could teach everything in Rust and have the Rust compiler also work as a free TA.

Universities have a challenge not wanting to teach technologies. You can teach a Haskell course because it is a functional langauge course just taught in Haskell. There is more here than just another syntax but rather something fundamental going on.

What about explorering memory safety as an entire topic. Like teach why a double free is a problem. How many people have written an exploit with a buffer overflow. That could be were you would teach this and then write a web server in Rust and make that impossible.

Bart says the response is memory safety is easy just use a garbage collector like everyone else. Why do all of this static anlysis to avoid the dynamic stuff.

Maybe combine two langauges into one and start in C and then do another langauge. At his univeristy they start in C and then they move to Python even though they are teaching locks and stuff.

There is a book called Snowman's Begin Rust 

I suggested a course that is about decoupling and design of software in Rust. Teach about how to separate out the core design to reduce the usage. So put this in the software engineering courses.

Environmental of using Rust because it helps with the environmental abilities because it is more efficient.

One of the challenges is what do we throw away to put this in? Because everyone views this as a zero sum game.

About half raised hand that they have put something out there to teach how to program in Rust.

One of the big reasons why OS courses are not taught in Rust is because it looks overwhelming for the professor to learn a new language and then teach that langauge when teaching is not there main thing doing research is.

Maybe they need to get some people in this room to volunteer with the goal of keeping the pieces as low effort as you think is resonable. Something that is not good enough is better than something that never appears.

How to teach people how to be good open source maintaineers around Rust.

There is already a lot of stuff that is out there that is good content. It would be good to map what is there for sure but the style that Bart described is not really there. But Rustlings is like that and Bart thinks highly of Rustlings.

Examples are not up, which is not ideal. Maybe once those are written and Bart can help and then once there are a few examples then hopefully we can get more examples.

It would be good to get a template but start with examples and generialize that into a template rather than the other way around.

For high schools maybe because of AP CS and stuff the focus should be on helping people program Rust in robotics and such
